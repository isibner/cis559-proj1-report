\section{Strategies and Concepts}
\subsection {Global scope}

Given the loose efficiency constraints given the problem, we decided that a globally optimal benefit function would be both feasible and desirable. The primary gain from this decision was a team optimized for late gameplay, where our players were able to seek out and steal balls toward the end of the game. The reason was that once we and other teams cleared the balls near our respective goals, balls became scarce. If any team had accumulated balls, even if they were far from our players, they would seek them out and attempt to score with them.

On the other hand, as teams improved, the game time grew shorter and quicker. In such a game, it is possible that a globally optimal zone will change into a depleted zone before a far-away team can reach it. It is likely that our model did not fully capture the constantly changing state of the game board. We addressed this by heavily weighting our own goal in benefit calculations.

\subsection{Cell clustering}
On the second iteration of our benefit function, we accounted for ball and opponent clustering by keeping track of the number of balls and opponents surrounding a particular cell. This allowed our players to seek out areas of high benefit, rather than single cells. 

After initial trials with a large radius, we settled on a radius of 3. We observed that larger radii caused the players to move back and forth somewhat inefficiently, and hypothesize that these larger zones changed too quickly for players to capitalize on them.

\section{Future Directions and Limitations}

\subsection{Generalized Step Distance}
This idea stems from our attempts to take advantage of global-scope “hotspots,” or high-density ball clusters that are not near the goal. The existing implementation weights balls close to the home goal particularly high, which is good in the early game, but may not be ideal overall. 

As we can see in figure [X], certain strategies tend to cluster balls near an opponent goal, where they stay relatively untouched for several cycles. A smarter global-cluster detection would drop the current strategy 

The biggest disadvantage to this approach is that the time it takes to travel to such a cluster may be greater than the the time the cluster exists. Even if the seeking team is able to reach the cluster in time, the balls lost in the transit time may not be worth it.

It would be possible to determine, by factoring in the number of balls left $B_{total}$, the number of balls in close range $B_{nearby}$, and the number of balls expected to remain in the cluster $B_{cluster}$. Such a strategy would decide to go for the cluster if and only if: 
$$B_{total} - B_{nearby} < B_{cluster}$$

One way of implementing this strategy would be to generalize the  \texttt{numberOfStepsToGoal()} benefit function to be \texttt{numberOfStepsToPosition(p)}, where the latter takes in any valid position $p$ as it’s argument, causing the cells around it to get a score boost. Then, upon deciding to pursue a cluster, this position would be updated to the cluster center, until a new position was found.
